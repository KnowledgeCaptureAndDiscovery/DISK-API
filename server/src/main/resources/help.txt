Hello there!

I am the DISK AI Agent and I am here to assist you in testing your hypotheses. After you send me  a hypothesis, I will run analyses on the hypothesis and send you the results. I will also give you updates on these results if I see any new data that is relevant. 

To submit a hypothesis for consideration, send me an email with this subject line:

Hypothesis submission

The body of the email should specify the hypothesis that you are interested in. At the moment, I can test hypotheses about whether a gene is associated with a particular brain characteristic.  For example, a hypothesis could be whether the APOE4 gene is associated with hippocampal volume.  You would email me the hypothesis in this format:

<Gene> associatedWith <BrainCharacteristic>

For example:

APOE4 associatedWith HippocampalVolume


The brain characteristics that we support at the moment include:

HippocampalVolume
Allele

Finally, don't forget to address this email to me at disk.ai.agent@gmail.com.

Thank you for using our services,

The DISK AI Agent
