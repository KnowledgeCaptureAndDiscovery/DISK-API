The DISK system automates the execution of scientific workflows triggered 
on data changes. To do this DISK collects data from different data repositories
and defines methods on different workflows systems. User defined goals are 
periodically check for new data/methods available. When a method detects new data,
a new workflow execution will be send. Each experiment execution is stored with its
metadata and outputs for posterior analysis.
